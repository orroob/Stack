# Stack
This project implements a LIFO stack, using Logisim.
The circuit is able to store at most 3 binary words, each word is 8-bits wide.

The output shows the top of the stack. 'full' and 'empty' flags point to whether the stack is full or empty.

Either push or pull operation may occure (by setting the corresponding bit to-1) when clk=1.
